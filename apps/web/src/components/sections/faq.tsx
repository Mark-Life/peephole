        Nowhere. The server binds <Chip>127.0.0.1</Chip> and reads your local{" "}
        <Chip>~/.claude</Chip>, <Chip>~/.codex</Chip>, and <Chip>~/.pi</Chip>{" "}
        transcripts directly. Telemetry is a local SQLite file with no network
        client anywhere in the codebase.

    answer: (
      <>
        Session browsing + context forensics for Claude Code, Codex, and Pi.
        Memory view/edit is Claude-only today. OpenCode identity is tracked but
        its transcripts aren&apos;t listable yet. The in-app capability matrix
        is the source of truth.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "How do you count tokens I can't see in the transcript?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Ground-truth usage. Retained thinking is stored as empty strings but
        reported in <Chip>output_tokens</Chip>; Peektrace reconstructs it as{" "}
        <Chip>output_tokens</Chip> minus visible text/tool_use, so peak context
        adds up to the real measured size.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Can it modify my files?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Only Claude memories, only when you ask, and only through atomic
        compare-and-swap writes. Run with <Chip>--read-only</Chip> to make
        writes impossible at the type level.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need Node, npm, or Bun?",
    answer: (
      <>
        No. The installer drops a single self-contained binary with the
        inspector UI baked in.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "What does 'dumb zone' mean?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Context usage at or above ~40% of the window &mdash; the empirical band
        where model quality starts to rot even though the tokens still fit.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "How do I report a bug?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Run <Chip>peektrace doctor</Chip>. It writes a fully redacted JSON
        support bundle to <Chip>~/.peektrace</Chip> locally &mdash; nothing is
        uploaded &mdash; then email that file to the maintainer at{" "}
